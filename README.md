## What is R8tes?
R8tes is a lightweight kubernetes controller that provides you with redis on demand. Designed to be used in a development environment where you need redis for testing and you need it fast. R8tes will create a redis instance for you and provide you with the connection details. 


## Why would you do this?
idk would you rather spend 5min(hours) setting up redis or 5 seconds?
